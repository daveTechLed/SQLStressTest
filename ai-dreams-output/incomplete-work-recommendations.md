# Incomplete Work Analysis - SQLStressTest

## Summary
This analysis identified 0 incomplete implementations that may cause runtime issues.

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Specific Files and Issues Detected:

#### No specific issues found
- **Status**: Analysis completed but no incomplete work issues detected
- **Action**: Review codebase for TODO, FIXME, HACK, or INCOMPLETE comments



## Agent Implementation Checklist

### 🔍 Phase 1: Read and Evaluate Each Issue
- [ ] **Review codebase for incomplete work**
  - [ ] Search for TODO, FIXME, HACK, INCOMPLETE comments
  - [ ] Check for placeholder implementations
  - [ ] Look for missing error handling
  - [ ] Identify incomplete features


### 🛠️ Phase 2: Implement Missing Code

#### High Priority - Parser Services (Critical for functionality)
- [ ] **No parser-specific issues found**
  - [ ] All parser services are complete
  - [ ] Focus on other incomplete work items


#### Medium Priority - Other Issues
- [ ] **No other incomplete work issues found**
  - [ ] All non-parser code is complete
  - [ ] Focus on parser implementations


### 🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Unit Testing**
  - [ ] Write tests for all new parser implementations
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios
  - [ ] Verify integration between components
  - [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Test end-to-end workflows with new parsers
  - [ ] Verify parser integration
  - [ ] Test AI Dreams generation
  - [ ] Validate output quality

### 📋 Phase 4: Documentation & Handoff
- [ ] **Update Documentation**
  - [ ] Document new parser implementations
  - [ ] Update API documentation
  - [ ] Create migration guides if needed
  - [ ] Update project README
- [ ] **Code Review Preparation**
  - [ ] Prepare code for review
  - [ ] Document architectural decisions
  - [ ] Create before/after comparisons
  - [ ] Prepare demonstration scenarios

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All TODO comments resolved with working implementations
- [ ] All FIXME items addressed with proper implementations
- [ ] All HACK workarounds replaced with proper solutions
- [ ] Full test coverage for new implementations
- [ ] Documentation updated and complete
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
