- **Uncovered Symbols:** 0
- **Coverage Percentage:** 0,00%
- **Execution Successful:** No

⚠️ **Warning:** Console app execution failed: No console app project file found

## Coverage Breakdown

### Covered
- Methods: 0
- Classes: 0
- Properties: 0

### Uncovered (Recommended for Removal)
- Methods: 0
- Classes: 0
- Properties: 0

## Uncovered Code Report

The following code was **not executed** during the console app run.
Since the console app represents 100% of required functionality, this code can likely be safely removed.

### No Uncovered Classes Found

All classes in the codebase were executed during the console app run.
## Estimated Impact

Removing all uncovered code would eliminate approximately:
- **0 symbols**
- Estimated lines of code reduction: TBD (requires file-level analysis)

## Action Items

1. Review the uncovered symbols listed above
2. Verify that these symbols are truly unused (no external dependencies)
3. Remove unused code in phases, starting with the highest confidence items
4. Re-run the console app after removals to ensure functionality remains intact
